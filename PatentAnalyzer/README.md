# PatentAnalyzer
Final Project for MPCS Python Programming


**Project Description**
I would like to develop an application which allows users to analyze information from the US Patent Office. The application will allow users to interact with it via the command line to support the following methods/actions. I will use the Patent search API developed in partnership with the US Patents Office found here: https://data.uspto.gov/apis/patent-file-wrapper/search.

Here are some preliminary methods that I would like to develop. I am not going to limit myself to these methods and will continuosuly refine the features based upon feasibility and end user value.

**Features**

    * Provide analysis on the number of patents filed within a designated date period
    * Allow the user to search patents by keywords or strings or across a combination of fields (i.e. combinations of attributes such as inventor, filing date, keyword, geography, etc.)
    * Allow the user to search the patent by different market sectors (i.e. healthcare, tech, etc.)
    * Allow the user to check on the status of a patent by providing the patent API
    * I would like to see if I can collate all the information returned from the query and send it to an LLM to summarize and identify key points from.

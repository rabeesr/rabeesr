# 👋 Welcome to My Early Git Repo!

## About Me

Hey there! I'm currently a student at University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a Masters in Computer Science. 

## Why This Repo?

This repository is my digital playground where I experiment with ideas, showcase projects, and document my journey through the fascinating world of tech and business. I hope that over time, I can see the progression in my skills and learn a thing or two. 

## Hobbies?

- **Chess ♟️**:
- **Logic Puzzles 🧩**: 
- **Basketball 🏀**: 
- **Stars and Cosmology 🌌**: I love reading about the physics and current theories around the formation of our universe. Please send good book recs my way.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects or discuss the latest trends in tech. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about product management, the next big tech innovation, or talk about the origins of the universe 🪐
